### Inheritance.
* Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class.

* There are 4 types of inheritance:
1. Single = classA -> classB
2. Multilevel = classA -> classB -> classC
3. Hierarchical = one parent(base class) many child(derived class) 
   * classA -> classB
   * classA -> classC
   * classA -> classD
4. Multiple = one child(derived class) many parents(base class)
