### Polymorphism
* The word polymorphism means having many forms. In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types. 
* Fuctions are mainly used in polymorphism.
* There are 2 types of polymorphism:
  * static/compile time = overloading(does not support by default in python have to use 3rd party package.)
  * dynamic/runtime = overriding
