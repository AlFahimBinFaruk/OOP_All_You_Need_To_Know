### Abstraction
* It hides the unnecessary code details from the user. Also,  when we do not want to give out sensitive parts of our code implementation and this is where data abstraction came.
* We use abstract-class,interface to achieve this in python.
* Concrete classes contain only concrete (normal)methods whereas abstract classes may contain both concrete methods and abstract methods.
* An abstract class is not a concrete class, it cannot be instantiated.
