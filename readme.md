## OOP all you need to know.
#### ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ There are mainly 4 pillars of OOP others things are just "common sense".
#### ðŸŽ‡ In this repo I have use Java to Explain the examples of OOP.
#### ðŸ§¨ Before starting this you have to have good knowledge about the architecture of the programming language you want to continue this on.  

### Fundamentals Knowledge.
* Classes.
* Objects.

### 4 Pillars of OOP.
* Polymorphism
  * Compile time/Static
    * Overloading
  * Runtime/Dynamic
    * Overriding
* Abstraction
  * It is design level.
  * Abstract - tell us what to do but not how to do.
  * Interfaces.
  * Lambda.
* Encapsulation
  * It is implementation level.
  * Private
  * getter and setter
* Inheritance
  * Single inheritance.
  * Multiple inheritance.
  * Multilevel inheritance.
  * Hierarchical inheritance
  * Hybrid inheritance.

### Important Topics.
* Constructors
* Array Related
  * Array
  * ArrayList
  * Linked list
  * Hashmap
* Keywords
  * this
  * super
  * new
* **Garbage Collection**
* **Manage memory allocation**
* Wrapper classes
  * The wrapper class of type **int** is **Integer**
* Static
* Interfaces
* **Type Casting.**
* Access modifiers/Controllers.
  * It defines the scope where the attribute/method/constructor can be accessed.
  * Public,Private,Static,Protected,Final.
* Packages.
* Lambda.
* Exception handling.
* Object Cloning.
* **Collection Module/Collection Frameworks**.
* Enums.
