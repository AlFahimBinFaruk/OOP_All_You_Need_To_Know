### Collection Framework
* Any group of individual objects which are represented as a single unit is known as the collection of the objects. In Java, a separate framework named the “Collection Framework” has been defined in JDK 1.2 which holds all the collection classes and interface in it.
The Collection interface (java.util.Collection) and Map interface (java.util.Map) are the two main “root” interfaces of Java collection classes.
* What is a Framework?
  * A framework is a set of classes and interfaces which provide a ready-made architecture. In order to implement a new feature or a class, there is no need to define a framework. However, an optimal object-oriented design always includes a framework with a collection of classes such that all the classes perform the same kind of task.
